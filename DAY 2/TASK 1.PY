# Overview of Python

# Python is a high-level, interpreted, and easy-to-learn programming language.
# It was created by Guido van Rossum and is widely used because of its simple syntax and readability.

# Python allows developers to write programs using fewer lines of code, making it beginner-friendly and powerful at the same time. It supports multiple programming styles such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

# Python is platform-independent, meaning the same code can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS without changes.

# 🔹 Features of Python

# Easy to read and write

# Free and open-source

# Large library support

# Interpreted language

# Supports object-oriented programming

# 🔹 Applications of Python (with Examples)
# 1️⃣ Web Development

# Python is used to build backend applications and websites.

# Example:
# A login system where Python checks username and password entered by the user and allows access.
username = {"admin"}
password = {"1234"}
if username == "admin" and password == "1234":
    print("Login Successful")

# 2️⃣ Data Analysis

# Python is used to analyze and process large amounts of data.

# Example:
# Calculating average marks of students.

marks = [80, 75, 90]
average = sum(marks) / len(marks)
print(average)

# 3️⃣ Machine Learning & AI

# Python is widely used in Artificial Intelligence because of libraries like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.

# Example:
# Predicting pass or fail based on marks.

if marks >= 40:
    print("Pass")
else:
    print("Fail")

# 4️⃣ Automation

# Python can automate repetitive tasks.

# Example:
# Automatically sending messages or processing files.

print("Task completed successfully")

# 5️⃣ Game Development

# Python is used to build simple games.

# Example:
# A number guessing game.

if guess == secret_number:
    print("You Win")

# 6️⃣ Backend Development

# Python is used to build APIs and server-side logic.

# Example:
# Returning user data from backend.

user = {"name": "Balaji", "age": 21}
print(user["name"])
